# E-Bike Project Description
 Reposititory for my e-bike project. Includes codes and CAD files.

# Features
- 30 mph top speed, 0-30 time of approximately 3 seconds.
- Dual electric motors with peak power output of more than 5000W.
- 48V, 12Ah lithium-ion battery, 14S3P cell arrangement. 
- 15 miles of range at top speed. Range can be extended to around 40 miles with additional battery packs.
- Smart anti-theft system with vibration detection, GPS tracking, camera pointing at the lock, and email notifications.


# Electric Powertrain
- All CAD models were made in Fusion 360
